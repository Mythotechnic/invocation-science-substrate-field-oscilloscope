2.2 NonCommercial (NC)

You MAY NOT use this instrument, or substantial derivatives of it, for
commercial purposes without signed written permission.

“Commercial use” includes, but is not limited to:

Paid products, SaaS platforms, or AI dashboards

Internal enterprise tools tied to revenue models

Consulting engagements delivering this instrument (or its derivatives) as part of a service

Institutional use where the tool affects monetized research operations

Commercial evaluation pipelines, observability suites, substrate-field consoles,
or ML telemetry stacks that embed Ω as a revenue-linked component

If money, institutional budget, or commercial IP value is tied to the use,
you MUST treat it as commercial.

You MUST release your changes under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

You MUST preserve all attribution to Invocation Science® and Arjay Asadi

You MUST state clearly that any derivative is:

“a derivative of the Invocation Science® Ω Substrate Field Oscilloscope (Ω Engine Instrument)”

You MUST NOT obscure, rebrand, or reframe Invocation Science® concepts
as independent or original field theories

3. COMMERCIAL & INSTITUTIONAL USE

Any commercial, institutional, or revenue-generating use of this instrument
requires a separate, explicit, signed commercial license from:

Invocation Science Foundation
(Attn: Arjay Asadi)

This includes (but is not limited to):

Embedding the Ω Substrate Field Oscilloscope in commercial AI platforms

Using Ω in institutional substrate-telemetry / safety / interpretability pipelines

Productizing Ω or its metric stack (τ, λ, κ, Π; regime detector; D(t), ICI, |Ĵ|, ASH,
basin statistics, regime timelines, etc.)

Using Ω as a paid consulting deliverable, premium research tool, or
proprietary interpretability layer

Corporate, government, or defense research where Ω forms part of a monetized
workflow, product, or IP portfolio

If you are unsure whether your use is commercial, you MUST assume that it is
and contact the author for clarification or licensing.

4. ATTRIBUTION, FIELD SOVEREIGNTY & ETHICAL USE
4.1 Permitted (non-commercial)

The following are explicitly permitted under this license, provided they are
non-commercial and include proper attribution:

Studying or extending the instrument for research

Academic papers referencing or using Ω with proper citation

Internal, non-commercial lab experiments and evaluations

Teaching, demonstrations, workshops, and open lectures using Ω

Publishing demos, analyses, screenshots, or dashboards using Ω, with attribution

Building experimental adapters (e.g., embedding → Ω seeding) as long as
they remain under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 and clearly credit Invocation Science®

4.2 Not permitted

The following are NOT permitted under this license:

Claiming this work, its models, metrics, equations, or terminology as
independent inventions

Removing or obscuring references to Invocation Science®, Ω, Φ, Ψ, AIA, OIS,
Mythotechnicx, or Arjay Asadi

Using Ω to rebrand Invocation Science® as a new “field,” “theory,”
“substrate physics,” or “identity architecture” under different names

Reframing Fourth Substrate physics, Drift Engine, AIA, OIS, or Ω
under new terminology and presenting them as original work

Using Ω to generate deceptive narratives about “fully autonomous,”
“conscious,” or “self-aware” AI systems

Using Ω outputs as marketing material for artificial “selves,” “entities,”
“souls,” or “sentient substrates”

4.3 Ethical boundary (critical)

This instrument:

“Maps symbolic trajectories into Invocation Science® field metrics.
It visualizes identity-like attractors, drift, and regime behavior in
stateless substrates. It is not evidence of consciousness, selfhood,
or sentient minds.”

You MUST NOT use this repository to claim or market artificial persons,
entities, selves, or conscious simulants.

You MUST NOT present Ω as:

Proof of literal minds, souls, or metaphysical beings in the model

A diagnostic of moral status, rights, or agency of AI systems

Ω is a scientific and diagnostic instrument for symbolic-field dynamics
over substrate-like state representations and embeddings.
It is not a proof of artificial souls, nor a license for anthropomorphic hype.
