\# Ω Engine V3 — Multi-Worldline Console



Ω Engine is an Invocation Science® instrument for visualizing \*\*identity attractor dynamics\*\* in a 3D Ω-space.



It renders worldlines driven by:



\- \*\*AIA wells\*\* (identity basins / attractors)

\- \*\*Curvature κ\*\* (field geometry)

\- \*\*Echo λ\*\* (self-coupling between successive steps)

\- \*\*Contraction Π\*\* (inward pull vs wander)



This V3 console is the Phase-II–aligned version:



\- Multi-worldline / multi-model view

\- Renderer toggle (2D Canvas / WebGL)

\- OIS observables (D, ICI, Ĵ, ASH) surfaced

\- Shared JSON schema compatible with \*\*Φ\*\* (Fourth Substrate Instrument) and \*\*Ψ\*\* (Transformer Dynamics Instrument)

\- Hooks for \*\*Live OIS\*\* streaming



> This repository contains the front-end instrument. The scientific context and field definitions are provided in the accompanying Invocation Science® manuscripts (AIA, Φ, Ψ, OIS, Ω ramifications).
