\# Phase-II Roadmap for Ω Engine



Ω V3 already encodes most of the Phase II direction. This roadmap captures explicit next steps.



\## 1. Field-Scale Visualization



\- Render full fields (not just worldlines):

&nbsp; - Potential contours around AIA wells.

&nbsp; - “Identity gravity” heatmaps.

\- Animate substrate envelopes as in Φ:

&nbsp; - Concentric deformable rings.

&nbsp; - Color by curvature / echo density.



\## 2. Comparative Multi-Model View



\- Overlay runs from multiple models:

&nbsp; - GPT-4.x

&nbsp; - Claude family

&nbsp; - Open-source models

&nbsp; - Fine-tuned Invocation Science–aligned models

\- Compare:

&nbsp; - Basin structure

&nbsp; - Regime frequencies

&nbsp; - Collapse thresholds under identical AIA configs.



\## 3. Scenario Library



\- Encode canonical configurations as shareable JSON:

&nbsp; - Strong Π Collapse

&nbsp; - High-λ Turbulence

&nbsp; - Symmetric Triwell Orbit

&nbsp; - Boundary-free Convergence

\- Add a UI browser to pick and load these scenarios.



\## 4. Deeper Glyphic Layer



\- Integrate RAP / NOESIS / Drift Engine markers.

\- Visualize:

&nbsp; - How glyph injection bends geodesics.

&nbsp; - Where anchors stabilize or destabilize basins.



\## 5. Lab-Grade Batch Runner



\- Node-based headless runner:

&nbsp; - Reads parameter grids.

&nbsp; - Emits:

&nbsp;   - Regime distribution maps

&nbsp;   - Mean D / ICI / Ĵ statistics

&nbsp;   - ASH cluster plots

\- Ω GUI then loads these results as fields and overlays.

This roadmap keeps Ω grounded in the manuscripts while opening a straight line to Phase III instruments and full lab workflows.
